# Voice Command Interface v3.3.0

I originally created this application to interact with World of Warcraft.  I was having trouble completing the Guardian Druid mage tower challenge in the Burning Legion expansion.  I was used to playing with the standard WOW interface, and a certain set of hotkeys tied to my keyboard and mouse.  The Guardian Druid mage tower challenge required me to use more abilities then I could setup with my hotkeys.  So ... in comes the Voice Command Interface.  It gave me the opportunity to bark out voice commands tied to some of my less commonly used abilities.
